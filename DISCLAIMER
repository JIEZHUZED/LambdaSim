## Disclaimer

λ-Sim allows to create a REST API implemented on top of
Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as
- lambda
- apigateway,
- S3,
- cloudwatch

**YOU MAY ENCOUNTER EXPENSES WHEN USING AWS SERVICE**

> By default λ-Sim makes your model open to the public, anyone will be able to
> access your model and therefore your account will
> be charged for the use of AWS services and resources required to serve the
> requests. I suggest you to carefully read and review AWS charges and policies.
> **The author/s of this project are not responsible in any way for the use and
> charges of the AWS services on your and any third-party account.
> USE THIS PROJECT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

If you're interested in limiting access to the REST API please have a
look at the AWS documentation
[apigateway-control-access-to-api](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-control-access-to-api.html)
