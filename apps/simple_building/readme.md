## Simple building energy model

This is a simple building energy model. The building
is located in San Francisco (CA) and the API
provides the ability to simulate the model using two different
input files, one for the winter period and one for the summer.

The source code of the model is available at
[ModelicaInAction/modelica/HelloWorld.mo](https://github.com/mbonvini/ModelicaInAction/blob/master/modelica/HelloWorld.mo).
